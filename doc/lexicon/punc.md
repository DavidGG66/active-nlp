# Punctuation

A punctuation edge has an empty list for semantics, with no hooks and nothing
subcategorized. Syntactically, other than the `cat` feature, the only feature
is `type`, indicating what type of punctuation it is. Here is the edge for
`;` as an example:
```
syn: {"cat": "PuncLex",
      "type": "semicolon"}
```
