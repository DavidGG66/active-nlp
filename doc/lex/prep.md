# Prepositions

There are three classes of prepositions, distinguished by how they are
incorporated semantically into the wider interpretation of the utterance:
Arguments, Noun adjuncts and Verb adjuncts

## Arguments

An argument preposition adds no semantics of its own - it only exists to
mark its object as a particular argument. For example:

I rely **on** her

Here, *on* serves only to mark *her* as something like the object of *rely*.
You could analyze particles, as in "I looked it **up**" as an intransitive form
of this preposition class.

### Intransitive
"up" as in "I looked it up"

```
syn: {
    "cat": "PrepLex",
    "pform": "up"}
sem: []
hooks: {},
subcat: []
```
